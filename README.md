# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using ARIMA and LSTM

This repository contains the implementation code used in the paper:  
**"Regression-based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using ARIMA and LSTM Algorithms"**

## üìÑ Description

The project compares two time series forecasting models ‚Äî ARIMA and LSTM ‚Äî for predicting daily Bitcoin closing prices. The analysis covers historical data from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2025.

The implementation includes:
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- ARIMA modeling with parameter selection (ADF test, AIC minimization)
- LSTM model built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training, testing, and evaluation with MAE and RMSE metrics
- Visualization of predictions vs actual prices

## üìÅ Files

- `bitcoin_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all code and results


## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- TensorFlow / Keras
